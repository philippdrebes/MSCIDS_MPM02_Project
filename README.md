# MSCIDS MPM02: Employee Turnover Prediction 

This is a group project for the module **Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling**, as part of the Applied Information and Data Science masters program at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset containing employee turnover data and develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. The following algorithms will be used in this project:

- Linear Model
- Generalized Linear Model with family set to Poisson
- Generalized Linear Model with family set to Binomial
- Generalized Additive Model
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine
- Optimization problem

We will use the programming language R and develop the project in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset we will be using is the [Employee Turnover](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/employee-turnover). This dataset contains information about the employees of a company such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, whether they have had a work accident, whether they have been promoted, their department, salary level, and whether they left the company or not.

## Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration: We will explore the dataset and perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Model Building: We will use the machine learning algorithms mentioned above to develop predictive models for employee turnover.
3. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and select the best model.
4. Conclusion: We will summarize our findings and discuss any insights gained from the analysis.

## Project Deliverables
The following deliverables will be submitted for this project:

- Jupyter Notebook in PDF format
- Jupyter Notebook containing all code and analysis
- README file containing project overview and instructions for reproducing the analysis

## How to Reproduce the Analysis
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/philippdrebes/MSCIDS_MPM02_Project` 
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4. Open the `employee-turnover-prediction.ipynb` file and run the cells in order.

Note: You may need to adjust file paths in the notebook to match your local file system.
