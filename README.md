# MSCIDS MPM02: Employee Turnover Prediction 

This is a group project for the module **Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling**, as part of the Applied Information and Data Science masters program at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset containing employee turnover data and develop predictive models using various machine learning algorithms. The following algorithms will be used in this project:

- Linear Model
- Generalized Linear Model with family set to Poisson
- Generalized Linear Model with family set to Binomial
- Generalized Additive Model
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine
- Optimization problem

## Dataset
The dataset we will be using is the [Employee Turnover](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/employee-turnover). This dataset contains information about the employees of a company such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, whether they have had a work accident, whether they have been promoted, their department, salary level, and whether they left the company or not.

## Project Structure

- data/turnover.csv -> data set
- employee-turnover-prediction.Rmd -> RMarkdown file containing the analysis
- Employee_Turnover_Prediction.pdf -> RMarkdown file compiled as PDF
- README.md -> this file

## Project Deliverables
The following deliverables will be submitted for this project:

- RMarkdown in PDF format
- RMarkdown containing all code and analysis
- README file containing project overview and instructions for reproducing the analysis

## How to Reproduce the Analysis
To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository: `git clone https://github.com/philippdrebes/MSCIDS_MPM02_Project` 
2. Launch R Studio
3. Open the `employee-turnover-prediction.Rmd` file and run the cells in order.

Note: You may need to adjust file paths in the notebook to match your local file system.
