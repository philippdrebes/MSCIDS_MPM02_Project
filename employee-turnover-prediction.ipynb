    "Welcome to our project on employee turnover prediction! In this project, we will be using various machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing employee turnover data and develop predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee turnover is a critical issue for companies, as it can result in significant costs such as recruitment, training, and lost productivity. Identifying factors that contribute to employee turnover and developing accurate predictive models can help companies better understand employee behavior and improve employee retention."
